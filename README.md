GenESe
======

My attempt to do an ElasticSearch plugin for data generation

Lots of ideas for it but taking time to realize them.

Based on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)


How to run
----------

Need npm and Grunt to compile Handlebars templates

Install dependencies through npm
```
npm install grunt grunt-cli grunt-ember-templates grunt-contrib-watch grunt-contrib-concat --save
```

Run Grunt with task watch: 
```
./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt watch
```
